# BEVFERLE

Have you ever wondered what the impact of different engine types are on emissions? Obviously Electric comes to mind, but there are other key details as well, and this tool is designed to help answer those questions by providing insights in to bus emissions data in New Zealands capital city, Wellington.

## Introduction

Like any city, Wellington, NZ has a complex public transport system that is forever pulling in different ways. One lense you can apply to improve the service is the environmental impact of the running the services for the city, and how we might best manage investment in the future to maximise impacts on reducing emissions, both greenhouse gases and harmful polutants.

## Background

This is the main repo for the redesign project of a research tool developed in 2020 for my engineering honours project.

Emma was the original project that was owned by Hamish Clark, who lead the initial implementation and creation of the base data set, and conceptual design. The visualisations were designed and implemented with a team of 3 software developers working with Greater Wellington Regional Council/NZTA to develop a research tool; in conjunction with Victoria University. The datasets the tool operates on was created from a mixture of several sources and was developed by the same team during this project.

BEVis (the Bus Emissions Visualiser) was broken off as a separate project for my honours.

BEVFERLE (Bus Emissions Visualiser For Emissions Research of Local Environments, pronounced "Beverly") is a redesign and refactor of the original codebase left after these projects. It uses React for UI, Redux for state management, and .NET 9 application running as a server.

### BEVis



### ATE

This project saught to extend the models and include new datasets to the original BEVis prototype.
