# The BEVis Redesign - BEVFERLE

This is the main repo for the redesign project of: https://warm-temple-67996.herokuapp.com/
a research tool developed in 2020 for my engineering honours project.

BEVis (the Bus Emissions Visualiser) is a tool that creates views of data on dynamic visualisations. The visualisations were designed and implemented
with a team of 3 software developers working with Greater Wellington Regional Council/NZTA to develop a research tool; in conjunction with Victoria University. 
The datasets the tool operates on was created from a mixture of several sources and was developed during this project as well.

BEVFERLE (pronounced "Beverly") is a redesign and refactor of the original codebase left after these projects. It uses React for UI, Redux for state management,
and has a Python (Flask) backend.
